# Model Predictive Control

## Overview
The MPC algorithm works on the basis of the data stream provided by the udacity simulator. This is a JSON object consisting of:
- X-Points: X-coordinates of the waypoints the car should follow in "global" coordinates
- Y-Points: Y-coordinates of the waypoints the car should follow in "global" coordinates
- X-Position: The car's X-Position
- Y-Position: The car's Y-Position
- Psi (Angle): The car's angle
- Velocity: The car's velocity
